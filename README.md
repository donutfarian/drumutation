Usage
-----

    usage: drumutation [-h] [--key] [--nsub NSUB] [--nbeat NBEAT] [--nbar NBAR] [-s STICKS] [drums [drums ...]]

    Create LilyPond sheet music for drum permutations.

    positional arguments:
      drums                 drum elements to permute

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      --key                 drum notation key
      --nsub NSUB           number of subdivisions
      --nbeat NBEAT         number of beats
      --nbar NBAR           number of bars (measures)
      -s STICKS, --sticking STICKS
                            drum sticking elements to permute

Example: Stick Control
----------------------

The first few pages (5-7) of George Lawrence Stone's *Stick Control:
For the Snare Drummer* are permutations of two bar, right (R) and left
(L) hand sticking patterns over 16th notes.

These exercises can be generated using the following command.

    $ drumutation --nsub 4 --nbeat 2 --sticking RL sn sn > stick-control.ly

* `--nsub 4`: The subdivision of each beat (pulse) is 4, i.e., 16th notes
* `--nbeat 2`: Find all two beat permutations (eight 16th notes)
* `--sticking RL sn sn`: Permute the snare (sn) with R and L hand sticking combinations

There are 256 possible two bar patterns. Drumutation outputs
[LilyPond][1] sheet music that can be rendered using

    $ lilypond stick-control.ly

The output is the seven page PDF [stick-control.pdf](docs/stick-control.pdf).

## Known Limitation

1. Only the 4/4 time signature is currently implemented.

## Drum Elements

The following drum elements can be permuted. The syntax mostly follows
[LilyPond's percussion notation][2].
